This is the Game Scenarios Linked List Module
This module implements a linked list data structure to store and manipulate game scenarios.
The ListNode class represents a single node in the linked list, with attributes for the node's value and the next node in the list.
The LinkedList class represents the linked list itself, with methods for appending nodes, converting the linked list data structure to a Python list data type, and a utility functions to get the final scenarios.
The get_game_scenarios function takes a list of game scenarios, shuffles the list randomly, and returns a linked list of the scenarios.

Example:
print(get_game_scenarios(["scenario1", "scenario2", "scenario3", "scenario4"]).to_list())

Note:
This module is designed to handle errors and exceptions, and provides informative error messages to help with debugging.

The following class represents a scenario in the game. Scenario is basically an occurence in the "day" of this game.

Each scenario has a unique number, an associated image for context, and a set of choices with possible outcomes.
The luck difference attribute represents a random value that can affect the outcome of the scenario.

The `set_cases()` method allows setting the caption, choices, and outcomes for the scenario.
The `__str__()`  method returns a string representation of the scenario, including its number.

Example:
    scenario1 = Scenario(1, "path/to/image.jpg")
    scenario1.set_cases(
        "You are at a fork in the road.",
