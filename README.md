# LUCKOMETER

LUCKOMETER is a thrilling game of chance that measures the luck of choices you make as the name suggests. The game starts at home and the day begins. The player starts off with randomized choices and a random luck score. You make your choices throughout the game, and each choice has an effect on the overall luck score. It is highly randomized, so no matter how sensible the choice seems, there might be a twist when it comes to the luck score it carries. The player's goal is to get the highest luck score at the end of the game.
